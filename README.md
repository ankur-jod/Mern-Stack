# MERN Stack Project

Welcome to our MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project repository! This repository contains the codebase for our full-stack web application.

## Overview

Our project is built using the MERN stack, a popular choice for building scalable and efficient web applications. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store our application's data. It provides flexibility and scalability for handling large volumes of data.

- **Express.js**: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web servers and APIs, making it ideal for our backend development.

- **React.js**: React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create interactive and dynamic frontends, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code on the server side. It provides the backend functionality for our application.

## Getting Started

To get started with our project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: 

git clone <repository_url>

2. **Install dependencies**:

cd <project_folder>
npm install

3. **Set up environment variables**:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- Define environment variables such as database connection URI, API keys, etc.

4. **Run the development server**:

npm start

5. **Access the application**:
- Once the development server is running, you can access the application at .....

## Folder Structure

Here's a brief overview of the folder structure of our project:

- **client/**: Contains the frontend code built using React.js.
